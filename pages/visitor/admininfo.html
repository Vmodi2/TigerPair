                        Hi beta testers!

                            href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevWjbcybKp2F8X93_NDbjF0xFO-5niqYDG61nvOhwQ0Jid_A/viewform?usp=sf_link'>Click

                        Some background: TigerPair an alumni matching platform that allows for various student groups to
                        sign up as admins and maintain matching of students and alumni in their group. But instead of
                        creating a different profile for other groups, students and alumni only need to create their
                        profile once. They can then move between any student group they have permission to join.
                        <br>
                        The site is rough around the edges right now, so any feedback we get would be extremely helpful!
                        The about text at the bottom is not the best, so please send questions in the below feedback
                        form! Also, every user account (student, alumni, and admin) has a basic tutorial available at
                        the bottom left corner of the page. Try those out if ur confused, let us know if they are really
                        bad!
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Since we already did a few alumni tests, we have opened up the alumni side to students for
                        testing (we can't get a ton of alumni testing it in this state). So when you are playing around
                        with it, feel free to make alumni or student account to test!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you are testing with friends, you can make an admin group account and have them sign up with
                        that group id/password too. But if you want to sign up for an established admin account, just
                        leave the group id section clear on the before we begin page. It will default you to group 0.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thanks so much!
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <!-- TigerPair is a user-friendly alumni engagement platform that finds optimal matches
                        based on features chosen by the mentorship project administrator. Any organization can
                        create
                        an administrative account, setting a custom group name and ID for their members to join.
                        Students and alumni can sign up themselves for any group, or have their profiles created by
                        the
                        admin. Using vectorization
                        techniques, our matching algorithm can analyze keywords
                        in the student and alumni profiles to find optimal pairs based on major,
                        degree type, general interests, preferred degree of involvement,
                        and any other feature that the admin desires to include. -->
