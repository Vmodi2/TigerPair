# TigerPair- Alumni Mentorship Made Simple!

Princeton has one of the most active alumni communities in the world, and they are always looking to help students. However, despite thousands of alumni returning to campus every year for reunions, opportunities for students to engage with alumni are drastically limited. Our projectâ€™s goal is to develop a user-friendly alumni engagement platform that finds optimal matches based on major, degree type, graduation year, preferred degree of intended involvement for both parties, etc. 

TigerPair finds mentorship pairings between alumni and students, serving as a launchpad for meeting and contacting each other. Ultimately we hope that this platform can be adopted by student groups throughout campus, so that they can increase alumni engagement. This platform will be built so that it can continuously be developed by whatever organization wants to take it over at the end of this semester. There is a strong need for a platform like this, and the university will not be able to provide a similar system for at least 3 years, we hope to fill in this critical gap going forwards.
